# SLC-SC-Example_Scripted-Connectors

This repository contains examples of Scripted Connectors.

These connectors can be written using Python or PowerShell. The scripts, in turn, transmit JSON data through a local HTTP call to the Data API. Subsequently, this action initiates the generation of an element through an automatically created connector. The Scripted Connectors are available through the module [Data Sources](https://docs.dataminer.services/user-guide/Advanced_Modules/Data_Sources/Data_Sources.html).

This  functionality has not yet been made available to the general public, but is available as a soft launch option. Follow the steps listed in [Installation and setup](https://aka.dataminer.services/scripted-connectors) to activate this functionality.
